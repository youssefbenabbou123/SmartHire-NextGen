# Quick Defense: "Why Trust Your Ranking?"

## The Question: "Who are you to rank candidates? Why should we trust you?"

## Your Answer (Memorize This):

---

### **"You don't have to trust us - you can verify everything.**

**We're not making subjective judgments. We've systematized the same objective criteria that professional recruiters use:**

1. **Company reputation** - Everyone knows FAANG > startups
2. **Skill matching** - Required skills must match candidate skills  
3. **Project quality** - Real projects using relevant technologies
4. **Career progression** - Junior to senior shows growth
5. **CV consistency** - Skills must align with experience

**The difference: We made it transparent, consistent, and explainable.**

**Unlike black-box AI, you can:**
- See exactly why each candidate scored what they did
- Verify every calculation
- Adjust the criteria if needed
- Understand the logic completely

**It's more fair than human-only screening because:**
- Same criteria for everyone (no bias)
- Fully transparent (no hidden judgments)
- Reproducible (same candidate = same score)
- Job-adaptive (scores based on YOUR requirements)

**We're not asking you to trust us - we're providing a tool you can verify."**

## If They Push Back:

**"The criteria aren't our opinions - they're industry-standard evaluation factors that recruiters use every day. We just made them systematic and transparent. You can see the logic, verify the math, and adjust if needed. That's more trustworthy than subjective human screening."**
