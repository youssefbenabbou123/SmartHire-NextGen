# Quick Explanation: Scoring Methodology

## The Question: "On what were you based to the scoring?"

## Your Answer (30 seconds):

**"Our scoring system is based on 5 objective dimensions totaling 100 points:**

1. **Experience Quality (35 points)** - Company reputation (tiered system: FAANG=15pts, Capgemini=12pts), role relevance to job, and duration with recency bonuses

2. **Technical Skills (25 points)** - Match between candidate skills and required skills, plus depth indicators (skills used in experience)

3. **Projects & Impact (20 points)** - Quality over quantity: detailed projects using required technologies score higher, with penalties for fake projects

4. **Education & Certifications (10 points)** - Degree relevance and recognized certifications (AWS, Azure, etc.)

5. **Signal & Consistency (10 points)** - CV coherence, career progression logic, and red flag detection

**The system is:**
- **Explainable** - Every score has clear reasoning
- **Job-Adaptive** - Adjusts to specific role requirements
- **Fair** - Same objective criteria for all candidates
- **Recruiter-Inspired** - Based on real hiring decision processes

**We use tie-breaking rules when scores are close, prioritizing experience quality first."**
