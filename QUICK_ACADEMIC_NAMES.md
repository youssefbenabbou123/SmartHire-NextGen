## What to Say (30 seconds):

**"Our ranking system uses Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, specifically the Weighted Sum Model approach developed by Hwang and Yoon in 1981. This is a well-established framework in operations research for evaluating multiple criteria simultaneously.**

**We've adapted it for recruitment by incorporating:**
- **Competency-Based Assessment** (McClelland, 1973)
- **Employer Branding Theory** (Ambler & Barrow, 1996)
- **Signaling Theory** (Spence, 1973)
- **Structured Evaluation Methodology** (Campion et al., 1997)

**This ensures our system is grounded in validated academic research while remaining transparent and explainable."**
